Instructions:
1. Please find the relevant source files for this project in the src folder in the directory this readme file is loacted in.
2. Please find the executable jar file, clockapp.jar, for this application in the directory this readme file is located in.

Notes:
The clockface provided in the assignment was used un-modified for the clock. However, StopWatchFace, the class used to draw the face
of the StopWatch, is a modified version of the clockface class provided in the assignment. The only difference is that it was modified
to draw numbers in increments of 5 instead of 1.

We also decided to include additional buttons for the stop watch which start, stop, and reset the stopwatch. It should be noted that
if the stopwatch is started, it will continue running until the user stops it or closes the application; the stopwatch does not stop when
the view is changed to the clock.
