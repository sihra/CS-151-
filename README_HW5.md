Requirements
 1. Class Diagrams
 2. Sequence Diagrams
 3. Be able to:
    1. Create a new project
       - Will contatin multiple tasks for each project
    2. Create a new task
       - Automatically put in the TO DO
    3. Edit task
       - In Progress, Review, Done "boxes"
    4. Load a saved taskboard. 
       - Also have a backlog of everything, I'm assuming is a collection of all the tasks within the project, we can have a button that goes to the log itself

Tasks
 1. Name should be bolded
 2. Description
 3. Due Date
    - We should have a page fold icon on tabs with no due dates so the user could click and add one if there was no due date
 4. Current Status
      - Being in the colums should be the current status, but we could have a view of all the taska with them being color coded and a legend of all the statuses
      - There could be different sortings too, like from date created, date due, or categorized by setting with to do tasks all at top to done tasks sorted last
          - She requires that when sorting from due date, the tasks without due dates will be at the bottom
 5. Color coded to category, maybe different shades of color would indicate which was more imprtant
      - The darker the color, the more important, can only go up to 3 shades to make colors stand out more
         - We can also sort through these
      - Gold can be done beacaure they're WINNERS
        
Login Page
 1. We can make a logo for our whole project and make it appear on this
 2. We should have a create account button too and just route it to go to another page that allows users to sign up with their email
 3. Also adding a forgot password would be cool too
 4. Also if they want to sync their to do list or join an exisitng one, we should allow that option but idk if we'd need to figure out how to make everything synced.
   - If we wanted to allow a setting where people could sign into a "workspace" with other people, we could have two options after they login, a button for their personal projects, workspaces they're a part of, and adding a workspace that would send an invite to the other workspace> 
        - Also this would be too much work but just throwing out ideas
        
Creating New Project/Task (After the Login page)
 1. After the login, Vidya requires use to have a create project, so we can have some buttons for create project and like a list view of all the other projects they have.
 
Main Screen
Columns
 1. Backlog, TO DO, In Progress, Review, Done
   - Should backlog be a button where you press and a column sort of pops from the left of the screen?
   - Vidya requires we have a + button for creating a new task in that section, and then also on the dashboard too, but that would be a general create new button for project or task
